* Getting Started:

** Start VMs

The VMs are created automatically by Vagrant. The provisioning is handled by ansible. Everything should be up an running after you type:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant up
#+END_SRC

** SSH into VMs

There are 3 different VMs created by Vagrant, called `server`, `client-1` and `client-2`

#+BEGIN_SRC
vagrant ssh client-1
#+END_SRC
